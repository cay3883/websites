            A restaurant, or, more informally, an eatery, is a business that prepares and 
            serves food and drinks to customers.[1] Meals are generally served and eaten on the premises,
             but many restaurants also offer take-out and food delivery services. Restaurants vary greatly in
              appearance and offerings, including a wide variety of cuisines and service models ranging from inexpensive 
              fast food restaurants and cafeterias, to mid-priced family restaurants, to high-priced luxury establishments.

  <p>in Western countries, most mid-to high-range restaurants serve
       alcoholic beverages such as beer and wine. Some restaurants
        serve all the major meals, such as breakfast, lunch, and dinner
         (e.g., major fast food chains, diners, hotel restaurants, and 
         airport restaurants). Other restaurants may serve only a single
          meal (for example, a pancake house may only serve breakfast) or 
          they may serve two meals (e.g., lunch and dinner).</p>

<p>In Japan, a restaurant culture emerged in the 16th century out of local
     tea houses. Tea house owner Sen no Rikyū created the kaiseki multi-course
      meal tradition, and his grandsons expanded the tradition to include speciality
       dishes and cutlery which matched the aesthetic of the food.[12]</p>

        and stews usually eaten at a common table. Parisians could buy what was essentially take-out food from rôtisseurs, who prepared roasted meat dishes, 
        and pastry-cooks, who could prepare meat pies and often more elaborate dishes. Municipal France in particular has a rich history with the development of
